# Dungeon Generation Project

Welcome to the Dungeon Generation Project! This project is inspired by Hypixel's Skyblock Dungeon Generator and aims to recreate a similar experience. It includes both the algorithm for dungeon generation and a user interface built with JavaFX.

**_Note: This project is still in development and may contain bugs or incomplete features._**

## Features

- **Procedural Dungeon Generation**: Generates a procedurally generate dungeon, similar to Hypixel Skyblock.
- **Interactive JavaFX UI**: Visualizes the generated dungeons, set the seed, and regenerate the dungeon.
- **Easily Customizable**: The code is modular and allows for easy customization of parameters and variables (such as required puzzles etc).
